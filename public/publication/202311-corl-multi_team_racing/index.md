abstract: "Autonomous racing is a challenging task that requires vehicle han-
dling at the dynamic limits of friction. While single-agent scenarios like Time
Trials are solved competitively with classical model-based or model-free feed-
back control, multi-agent wheel-to-wheel racing poses several challenges includ-
ing planning over unknown opponent intentions as well as negotiating interac-
tions under dynamic constraints. We propose to address these challenges via a
learning-based approach that effectively combines model-based techniques, mas-
sively parallel simulation, and self-play reinforcement learning to enable zero-
shot sim-to-real transfer of highly dynamic policies. We deploy our algorithm in
wheel-to-wheel multi-agent races on scale hardware to demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach."

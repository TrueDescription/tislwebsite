abstract :  Directional estimation is a common problem in many tracking applications. Traditional filters such as the Kalman filter perform poorly in a directional setting because they fail to take the periodic nature of the problem into account. We present a recursive filter for directional data based on the Bingham distribution in two dimensions. The proposed filter can be applied to circular filtering problems with 180 degree symmetry, i.e., rotations by 180 degrees cannot be distinguished. It is easily implemented using standard numerical techniques and is suitable for real-time applications. The presented approach is extensible to quaternions, which allow tracking arbitrary three-dimensional orientations. We evaluate our filter in a challenging scenario and compare it to a traditional Kalman filtering approach.

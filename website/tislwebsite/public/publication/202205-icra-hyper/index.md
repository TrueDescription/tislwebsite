title : "HYPER: Learned Hybrid Trajectory Prediction via Factored Inference and Adaptive Sampling"

abstract: "Modeling multi-modal high-level intent is important for ensuring diversity in trajectory prediction. Existing  approaches explore the discrete nature of human intent before  predicting continuous trajectories, to improve accuracy and  support explainability. However, these approaches often assume  the intent to remain fixed over the prediction horizon, which  is problematic in practice, especially over longer horizons. To  overcome this limitation, we introduce HYPER, a general and  expressive hybrid prediction framework that models evolving  human intent. By modeling traffic agents as a hybrid discrete-  continuous system, our approach is capable of predicting discrete intent changes over time. We learn the probabilistic hybrid  model via a maximum likelihood estimation problem and leverage neural proposal distributions to sample adaptively from  the exponentially growing discrete space. The overall approach  affords a better trade-off between accuracy and coverage. We  train and validate our model on the Argoverse dataset, and  demonstrate its effectiveness through comprehensive ablation  studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art models"

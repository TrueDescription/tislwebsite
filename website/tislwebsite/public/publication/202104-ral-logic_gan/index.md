title : "Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Using Generative Adversarial Network with Temporal Logic Syntax Tree Features"

abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for integrating rules into traffic agent trajectory prediction. Consideration of rules is important for understanding how people behaveâ€”yet, it cannot be assumed that rules are always followed. To address this challenge, we evaluate different approaches of integrating rules as inductive biases into deep learning-based prediction models. We propose a framework based on generative adversarial networks that uses tools from formal methods, namely signal temporal logic and syntax trees. This allows us to leverage information on rule obedience as features in neural networks and improves prediction accuracy without biasing towards lawful behavior. We evaluate our method on a real-world driving dataset and show improvement in performance over off-the-shelf predictors.
